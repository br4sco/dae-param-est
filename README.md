# dae-param-est
A Parameter Estimation Experiment for DAEs  
For the code used in our paper (TODO: Add link to paper), please see the branch "cdc"

# Prerequisites
The simulation routine is implemented in
[julia](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/), see their homepage for
installations instructions on your platform.

You will need to install some additional julia packages. The julia repl
(`julia`) will notify you which packages are missing when you include the
simulation implementation `include("simulation.jl")` and how to install them.
