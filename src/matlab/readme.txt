The Matlab file stabilised_analytical_delta_robot.m can be used to help generate the model equations for the stabilised delta robot. The resuling .txt files are not formated correcly for julia. In the file MATLAB_TO_JULIA.txt, commands that can be run in Windows Powershell to replace the symbols in the txt-files generated by Matlab so that we get expressions on a form that can be used in Julia, sometimes after some smaller modifications that can be done conveniently in most text editors.
